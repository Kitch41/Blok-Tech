Game Buddy is a matching app that will find you your ultimate gaming friend. With this app you'll never have to search endlessly through those lfg(Looking for Group) pages for the right people to be your game buddy's. With Game Buddy you can add your favorite games and rank to your profile and based on that you will be matched with people that like the same games and are around the same rank as you. isn't that awesome!

## Job Story

**When** I'm lonely at home playing some videogames by myself.
**I** want to find people who play the same games as me and like to play with me.
**So** we can play games together and become Game Buddy's

### Templating engine

for templating engine i used EJS, 
first i started looking into what templating engine was the best and i was quickly convinced by my classmates to pick EJS. I looked into how to use it and started working with it almost immediately. The way i used it was to make partials and use them in my pages, and secondly i used it to show data from the database to the profile page

### Linter

as for linters i tried to use EJSLint for a while but nothing worked so i just went with prettier to make my code look a lot better.

* [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier)


### License

I used a MIT license since this one seemed most appropriate for the app i'm trying to make. and since its a school project i'm not concerned about people using my code for whatever purpose.
